# AntiMechSim
These simulations were written in C++ as a senior year project by Fivos Asimakopoulos (email: fivasim at gmail.com)

These versions are preliminary ones, without much attention to the relative gear diameters or vertical positions. However, the teeth count of the gears and the operation are accurate.

Again, as for the animations, there are two versions of the simulation: one according to Price, and one according to the recent findings of the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project. The only inaccuracy of the new version is the fact that gears K1-K2 are fixed and they do not rotate along with gear E4. This will be fixed in the next version along with the correct inscriptions of the faceplates.

Instructions:

run the .exe files. File "antikythera_price" is the simulator of Price's reconstruction while file "antikythera_new" is the simulator of the new reconstruction.

Operation of the mechanism can be performed by either the keyboard or the mouse.

##Keyboard

Key	Operation	

0-9	Rotation speed
~	Reverse rotation
Z,X,C	Rotate the mechanism clockwise
z,x,c	Rotate the mechanism counter-clockwise
r,R	Reset
space	Step operation
t,T	Toggle plates on and off
+,-	Zoom in or out
arrows	Move mechanism up, down, left, or right

##Mouse

Left click and drag	Rotate mechanism
Right click and drag	Move mechanism
Center (or wheel button) click and drag	Zoom
Wheel	Animate mechanism
