These simulations were written in C++ as a senior year project by Fivos Asimakopoulos.

These versions are preliminary ones, without much attention to the relative gear diameters or vertical positions.
However, the teeth count of the gears and the operation are accurate.

There are two versions of the simulation: one according to Price, and one according to the recent findings
of the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project.
The only inaccuracy of the new version is the fact that gears K1-K2 are fixed and they do not rotate along
with gear E4. This will be fixed in the next file version along with the correct inscriptions of the faceplates.

Instructions:

Just run the .exe files. File "antikythera_price" is the simulator of Price's reconstruction,
while file "antikythera_new" is the simulator of the new reconstruction.

Operation of the mechanism can be performed by either the keyboard or the mouse.

Keyboard

Key		Operation
__________________________
0-9		Rotation speed
~		Reverse rotation
Z,X,C		Rotate the mechanism clockwise
z,x,c		Rotate the mechanism counter-clockwise
r,R		Reset
space		Step operation
t,T		Toggle plates on and off
+,- 		Zoom in or out
arrows		Move mechanism up, down, left, or right

Mouse 
_________________________
Left click and drag				Rotate mechanism
Right click and drag				Move mechanism
Center (or wheel button) click and drag		Zoom

Have fun!


Version History:
v0.93
- Corrected the sizes and positions of rear pointers
- Small rear dials are now visible
v0.92
- The main rear pointers are now centered. However, the small pointers are still longer.
- The plates have a new rendering, closer to the original.
v0.9
- Corrected gear diameters in -new version
- It now starts with plates invisible
v0.8
- Fixed bug in -new version, where, stepping with the space bar did not move the pointers

v0.7
- First Release
